# Beyond the farewell
A guide to the practical matters that need to be dealt with in the many months that follow after someone's death, beyond the immediate matters (eg. death certificate, funeral).

The guide may also be helpful:

- Prior to the decline in mental or physical capacity of the individual,
- in the end of life (EOL) stage of the individual,
- as a resource or of general interest, providing some thoughts and ideas on preparing for eventuality.

## 0. Introduction
**Motivation:** There is plenty of support and information around for people who may be involved in the support or care of an individual who may be infirm, long term sickness, have a disability or be elderly or in the latter time of their life. However beyond the loss of that individual there is little information or support for **beyond the farewell** and hence the motivation for producing this guide.

It is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both my elderly parents and my interaction with other 'carers'. Consequently this experience also highlights matters for which it would be a great help to deal with before the end of life.

The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work on progress anyway because everyone's circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything❗, but it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere.

## 1. Before end of life

To make future matters easier these are some things to do, consider or arrange for future access well in advance of either the death or loss of mental or physical capacity. To do so after EOL (End Of Life) would be difficult or too late:

### Financial
-   Become a joint account holder on their bank account(s)
	- But **administrate** only!  <br>Else complications arise - you may be viewed as having additional savings and thus be above the threshold for [carers allowance](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance), other financial support or be liable for [capital gains tax](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax).
	- A benefit is the account(s) automatically transfer to the surviving holder.

Remember [Power of Attorney](https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney) is valid only whilst the person is alive.

### Medical donation
Needs to be done weeks or months in advance of the loss of someone and may or may not need their permission and thus for them to have mental capacity to do so.

-   Donating organs or body to medical research - find out early, arrange well in advance of death.
-   [Brain bank](https://presearch.com/search?q=brain+bank) - search the internet, there may be several to choose from.

### DNA Sample
-   Obtain a DNA kit and sample for genealogy purposes – more than one service is better, but may be expensive.
-   Keep DNA sample for prosperity or future analysis:
	- Lock of hair?
	- How to store to preserve and avoid further contamination?
-   Your suggestions?

### Usernames, passwords, passphrases, encryption keys, etc:
* Online banking, Insurance companies
* Utilities companies, council
* Social media, clubs, societies etc.
* Email accounts
* Their personal computer login details
* Encrypted media
* Anything else ?

Make backups!

### Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), Digital Assets

Distribulted Ledger Technologies are a relatively new technology (2009). It is increasingly possible people may hold these digital assets in the form of:

* **Cryptocurrencies** eg. Ethereum, Cardano, Monero, Bitcoin and hundreds of others.
* **NFTs** - Non-fungible tokens
* **DeFi** - Decentralised finance

They may be held in digital wallets (eg. [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) or [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/)) or on exchanges (eg. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/)). Access to them may require:
- Public+Private keys.
- Wallet password or phrase.
- Recovery phrase: a set of words, may be 12 or more.

Make backups!

Note the digital asset value may or may not be potentially significant:  
For example the approximate minimum price for a whole Bitcoin in Nov. 2022, was US$15,500 (~£14,000). In 2028 that minimum is expected to be US$100,000 and between 2028 and 2037 reach $1,000,000, a significant increase.

### Family History

 - A **timeline** history of their life.
   * This Timeline Project software may help: https://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/, it's free and opensource.
- **Family Tree**, who fits where, who was that relative you met in the past?
  * Of course there are commercial services offering to help with this, but Gramps is free and opensource software you can install on your own computer to assist: https://gramps-project.org/blog/.

## 2. Beyond end of life

Beyond the immediate matters to attend to following someones death.

This may be a challenging time with an overwhelming number of things to deal with and feel surreal in the new reality.

May be filled with mixed emotions and a lifetime of memories as you deal with matters and sorting out.

### Government  website & Tell Us Once
Amongst the first things to be done is follow the government website guide https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies. 

This includes the Tell Us Once service to notify multiple government departments and organisations, however consider carefully which to include. https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once

It may be wise to notify the DVLA separately as the vehicle tax may otherwise end and you would be unable to drive it on public roads.

#### Probate, Estate, Inheritance Tax and Property Records
These are included in the government guide.
(I have yet to do these)

* Probate does not apply to everyone.
* Takes up to 16 weeks to process.
* Probate enables...?
	-  needs to be done within one year of the death
* Estimate value of the estate for any Inheritance Tax
    - Inheritance tax is paid on the amount over a threshold. That threshold depends upon individual circumstances.

### Support ends suddenly
Support from care worker visits, health visits, council and government support, telephone support from various charities|agencies all come to an end quite suddenly. You no longer have contact with these support people you have got to know and it may leave you feeling isolated, cut off, alone and forgotten about.

Thankfully you may continue with Carers Trust Solihull for 12 months after the death - much appreciated.

#### Need someone to look after YOU
Depends upon your circumstances, health and age, but if you are the only one left living in the house, who is going to look out for or look after you ?

### Return support equipment
For me this was fairly straight forward.

 - Contact Solihull Council Adult Care Services, arrange for collection of support equipment, mobility aids, wheel chair, safety rails. 
 - Contact Safe & Sound to return fall alarms.
 - Institute for Deaf equipment return.
 - What else?

### Physical personal items
These are part of the Estate. 
It is likely thee will be a large number of items to find new home for, eg. clothes, electrical|electronic items, furniture, tools, plant pots, garden equipment, timber, hobby items, vehicles.

-   Which to keep for prosperity, sentiment or reuse oneself?
-   Sell items (how?):
	- Auctions?
	- Internet?
	- We Buy Any Clothes?
-   Charity items?
-   Reuse?
-   Recycle, up-cycle or reuse what's left.
	- [Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/) will recycle electrical and electronic items : https://www.currys.co.uk/services/delivery-installation/recycling.html
-   Your suggestions?

### Hidden Items
There may be important notes, paperwork, stash of cash, information and other items of importance hiding about the property:

-   Go through every page of every book and magazine, all the compartments of every bag, purse and wallet, all pockets in all clothing, look for hidden|secret pockets too.
-   Hidden compartments in the property, furniture, under the floorboards, attic|loft, garden shed, garage.

### Important Paperwork
-   Family wills, birth|marriage|death certificates
	- Make copies and backups
	- Make good quality scans to digitise and store on computer
-   Property deeds, you may need to transfer property registration to the inheritors name.
- Memoirs.

### Financial
 - Pensions: cancel private pensions, repay over payments.
 - Bank accounts: Keep a record of the amount in the accounts at the time of death.
 - Pay outstanding bills, debts, HMRC taxes, return over payments.

### Digital data, computers, online accounts, etc.
 - Backup (make a copy) their computer data or storage media before making any changes to it.
 - ??

### Investing inheritance - financial
If sufficient finance is left over, consider putting the money to use to earn interest, eg.:

 - National Savings and Investments, https://www.nsandi.com/,  Bonds, ISAs etc.
 - DeFi, decentralised finance, a relatively new option, do your own research.
 - Your suggestions here.

    
### Preserving their legacy ...how?
Perhaps the one you cared for produced some items from their hobbies or work that are worth preserving. How will people know about their work and what they did unless it is made visible by some means. What are your options?

Eg. amongst the many practical skills my father had, one of his hobbies was artwork painting, especially portraits and landscapes. How can I make his artwork publicly known, visible, preserved and permanent? 

* Virtual art gallery?
* Exhibition, but may only be temporary.
*  **NFTs :** It is possible to digitise artwork and make it publicly available via non-fungible token platforms.
* Consider copyright, attribution and licence issues.
 * Your suggestions here.

#### After someone has died what does obtaining probate mean?

When someone dies, their assets and property are passed on to their beneficiaries through a legal process called probate. Probate is the court-supervised process of settling the estate of a deceased person. The purpose of probate is to ensure that the deceased person's assets are distributed according to their wishes as outlined in their will, or according to state laws if they did not have a will.

Obtaining probate means that the executor or administrator of the deceased person's estate applies to the court for a document called a "grant of probate." This document gives the executor or administrator the legal authority to manage the deceased person's assets and distribute them to the beneficiaries.

In order to obtain probate, the executor or administrator must present the will to the court, along with certain other documents, and prove that the will is valid. The executor or administrator may also be required to give notice to certain people and/or organizations, such as creditors, that probate has begun.

The probate process can be lengthy and complex, and it is important for the executor or administrator to be aware of their duties and responsibilities during this time. They also may consider hiring a lawyer to help with the process.

It's worth noting that not all assets require probate, assets that are held jointly or assets with designated beneficiaries such as life insurance and retirement accounts. These assets pass to the designated person without the need of probate.
