A guide to the practical matters that need to be dealt with in the many months or years that follow someone's death, beyond the immediate concerns (e.g., death certificate, funeral, pets), the aspects discussed are also applicable to ourselves at any age and any stage of life.

The guide may also be helpful:

- For ourselves at any time from now to our distant future.
- Prior to any decline in mental or physical capacity of the individual.
- During the end-of-life (EOL) stage of the individual.
- As a resource or of general interest to stimulate thought and spark ideas on preparing for eventualities.

## 0. Introduction

**Motivation:** There is plenty of support and information available for people who may be involved in the support or care of an individual with infirmity, long term sickness, have a disability or be elderly or in the latter time of their life. However beyond the loss of that individual there is little information or support **beyond the farewell** and hence the motivation for producing this guide.

It is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both my elderly parents and my interaction with other 'carers'. Consequently this experience also highlights matters for which it would be a great help to deal with before an end of life.

Although <abbr title="United Kingdom">U.K.</abbr> oriented it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere globally.

The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work on progress anyway because everyone's circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything! Hence...

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Feedback welcome:** with suggestions for improvement, additions or corrections, go to [Issues](https://github.com/beyondthefarewell/beyondthefarewell.github.io/issues) on the project website and either click on an existing issue or open a `New issue`.

The guide is not advice, but intended to offer suggestions and stimulate thoughts and ideas on matters and issues that are relevant to your life or anyone at any age or stage of life, not just those approaching an end of life. 

I hope it helps.

## 1. Before end of life

To make future matters easier these are some things to do, consider or arrange for future access well in advance of either the death or loss of mental or physical capacity of someone. To do so after EOL (End Of Life) would be difficult or too late:

### Financial
-   Become a joint account holder on their bank account(s)
	- But **administrate** only !  <br>Else complications arise - you may be viewed as having additional savings and thus be above the threshold for [carers allowance](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance), other financial support or be liable for [capital gains tax](https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax).
	- A benefit is the account(s) automatically transfer to the surviving holder.

Remember [Power of Attorney](https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney) is valid only whilst the person is alive.

### Medical donation
Organ, tissue or body donation for medical or scientific research or for transplantation to save another person‚Äôs life. This process needs to be investigated and arranged well in advance of an end of life, the requirements for permission may depend on the individual‚Äôs mental capacity and the relevant local legal framework.

-   The [NHS organ donation](https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/) website is a reference for information and registration for the UK, otherwise search the internet for [your region](https://search.brave.com/search?q=organ+donation) of the world.
-   [Brain bank](https://presearch.com/search?q=brain+bank) donation - search the internet, there may be several to choose from.

### DNA Sample
-   Obtain a DNA kit and provide a DNA sample for genealogy purposes ‚Äì more than one service is better, but may be expensive.
-   Keep a DNA sample for prosperity or future analysis:
	- Lock of hair?
	- How to store to preserve and avoid further contamination?
-   Your suggestions ?

### Life Story, Family History, Family Tree
Whilst a person is still alive it is the last opportunity to find out more about their life, their life story, family history and perhaps document it and fill in gaps in the family tree... Who were those people you met in the past? Were they long lost relatives? Where do they fit in the family history and family tree? What's the story behind that family heirloom?

Here are some suggestions and tools that may help:

- A **timeline** history of their life.
   * This [Timeline Project](https://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/) software may help, it's free and opensource software.
- Update or create the **Family Tree**.
  * Of course there are commercial services offering to help with this, but [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/) is free and opensource software you can install on your own computer to assist.

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Emerging technologies** in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) may present us with other opportunities to preserve the life of someone, perhaps in the form of a digital model of them that we can talk with and interact with. While this is possible now it requires a high level of technical expertise that few possess, however tools for this may be developed rapidly and become more accessible and user-friendly.

### Passing on the passwords, passphrases, passkeys, encryption keys, key pairs, brain keys, usernames etc:
With the agreement of the account holder consider becoming a joint account holder or administrator on the following, it will make matters easier to deal with beyond EOL.

* Online banking, Insurance companies
* Utilities companies, council
* Social media, clubs, societies etc.
* Email accounts
* Their personal computer login details
* Encrypted media
* 'Cloud' data storage
* Anything else ?

**Make backups !**

Of course whilst a person is alive, well and able they would likely want to keep
access details a secret, but how could they pass on the details to
executors of a Will, family members or whoever in the event of EOL or loss of
mental capacity or other loss of ability to use a computer? 

How you do this will be your joint preference and depend upon your level of technical ability. A couple of thoughts:

* A simple option: write down the details and put in a sealed envelope.
* The account holder to use a [password manager](https://presearch.com/search?q=define%3A%22password+manager%22) (eg. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)) and pass on, by some agreed means, only the password manager access details.

Remember that Wills get published and made public on Grant of Probate, so the above information should not be included in or passed on via a Will.


### Digital Assets, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs)

Distributed Ledger Technologies are a relatively new technology, gaining prominence with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. It is increasingly likely people may hold these digital assets in the form of:

* **Cryptocurrencies** e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Monero and hundreds of others.
* **NFTs** - Non-fungible tokens.
* **DeFi** - Decentralised finance.

These assets may be held in digital wallets (eg. [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) or [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/)) or on exchanges (eg. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/)). Access to them may require:

- Public plus Private keys üîëüîë
- Wallet password or phrase.
- Recovery phrase: a set of words, may be 12 or more.

If those are lost the asset *(money!)* is lost with no means of recovery, so...

**Make backups !**

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è The digital asset value may or may not be potentially significant:  
> For example, using the [Bitcoin long term power law](https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/) as a guide, the approximate minimum price for a whole Bitcoin in November 2022, was US$15,500 (~¬£14,000). In 2028 that minimum is projected to be US$100,000 and sometime between 2028 and 2037 potentially reach US$1,000,000, a significant increase.

### Pets üêï üêà üê¶ üêù ü¶ï üêç üêá ü¶ñ

What should happen to pets after their owner loses capacity or dies ?  
What are the owners wishes for the pets future ?  
Arrangements need to be made in advance.

- The [RSPCA](https://www.rspca.org.uk/) offer a [Home for Life](https://homeforlife.org.uk/) service to cater for pets after the owner dies.
- There is also [The Cinnamon Trust](https://cinnamon.org.uk/), The National Charity for older people, the terminally ill and their pets.

### Where is the paperwork ?

See [Important Paperwork](./#important-paperwork) in the next section. Knowing this can ease the process of finding the paperwork later.

- If any, where and with whom is the Will lodged ?
- Have any **wishes** been expressed separate to the Will ? Are these written down somewhere ?

## 2. Beyond end of life

Matters to attend to beyond the immediate matters following someone's death.

This may be a challenging time with an overwhelming number of things to deal with and feel surreal in the new reality. It may be filled with mixed emotions and a lifetime of memories as you deal with matters and sorting out.

### Government  website & Tell Us Once
Amongst the first things to be done is follow the government website guide **[What to do when someone dies](https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies)**:
[https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies](https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies).

This includes the **[Tell Us Once](https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once)** service to notify multiple government departments and organisations, however consider carefully which to include. [https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once](https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once)

It may be wise to notify the [DVLA](https://dvla.gov.uk) separately as changing the details in the [Log Book](https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/number-plate) will end the current vehicle tax and you would be unable to drive it on public roads. The LOG Book changes may take six weeks to process.

#### Probate, Estate, Inheritance Tax and Property Records
These are included in the government guide.
* Probate does not apply to everyone.
	- **Grant of probate** gives the executor or administrator the legal authority to manage the deceased person's assets.
	- May take up to 16 weeks to process the application.
	- Apply at your earliest convenience.
	- Needs to be done within one year of the death.
* Estimate value of the estate for any Inheritance Tax
    - Inheritance tax is paid on the amount over a threshold. That threshold depends upon individual circumstances.
    - A property valuation by an estate agent may be required.
* Update the property records.

### Support ends suddenly
Support from care worker visits, health visits, council and government support, telephone support from various charities and agencies all come to an end quite suddenly. You no longer have contact with these support people you have got to know and it may leave you feeling isolated, cut off, alone and forgotten about.

#### Need someone to look after YOU
Depends upon your circumstances, health and age, but if you are the only one left living in the house, who is going to look out for you or look after you ?

### Preserving memories?

Before doing any sorting or changing the home of the deceased, consider photographing or making videos of the rooms and garden to help remember it as it was.

### The letter box or post box üì® üì¨
Letters or mail arriving in the post can be a help in identifying overlooked matters to deal with or of organisations to notify of the death.

However, there may also be unwanted or unneeded promotional advertising mail, a possible way to reduce or stop this is to write ***Deceased - Return to sender*** on the envelope and return it in the post box.

### Return support equipment
For me this was fairly straight forward.

 - Contact the local council Adult Care Services, arrange for collection of support equipment, mobility aids, wheel chair, safety rails. 
 - Contact fall alarm and other emergency alarm providers.
 - Institute for Deaf equipment return.
 - What else ?

### Financial
 - Pensions: cancel private pensions, repay over payments.
 - Bank accounts: Keep a record of the amount in the accounts at the time of death, it may be needed for probate or other matters.
 - Pay outstanding bills, debts, HMRC taxes, settle any differences in amounts.
 - [Trace old accounts and lost money](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/money-legal/debt-savings/how-to-trace-lost-money/), this may include stocks and shares, bank and other financial accounts, pensions etc.
 - Any others?

### Investing inheritance - financial
If sufficient finance is left over, consider putting the money to use to earn interest, eg.:

 - [National Savings and Investments](https://www.nsandi.com/): Bonds, ISAs etc.
 - [DeFi](https://presearch.com/search?q=defi+decentralized+finance), decentralised finance, a relatively new option, do your own research.
 - Your suggestions here.

### Medicines ‚öïÔ∏è
Unused, part-used or old medicines should be taken to a pharmacy for disposal.

**Do not** dispose of medicines in the waste bin, wash down the sink or flush down a toilet, as that would contaminate the environment, enter the food chain, harm wildlife, plants, animals, food and humans!

- Syringes üíâ, clinical waste, surgical waste: It can be dangerous to put this in household waste, dispose of via a pharmacy or local council clinical waste service.

### Physical personal items
These are part of the Estate.  

It is likely thee will be a large number of items to find new home for, eg. clothes, electrical and electronic items, furniture, tools, plant pots, garden equipment, timber, hobby items, vehicles.

-   Which to keep for prosperity, sentiment or reuse oneself ?
-   Sell items (how?):
	- Auctions ?
	- Internet ?
	- [Cash for Clothes](https://www.cashforclothes.org.uk/) ?
-   Charity items ?
	- some charities will collect from your location if you cannot take items to them.
-   Recycle, up-cycle or reuse what's left ?
	- [Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/) will [recycle electrical and electronic items](https://www.currys.co.uk/services/delivery-installation/recycling.html).
	- The [Recycle Now](https://www.recyclenow.com/) website may provide you with more ideas and guidance.
-   Your suggestions ?

This reference may be of help: *[The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning](The%20Gentle%20Art%20of%20Swedish%20Death%20Cleaning)* a concept and lighthearted [book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Gentle-Art-of-Swedish-Death-Cleaning/Margareta-Magnusson/9781501173240) and subsequent [TV series](https://u.co.uk/shows/the-gentle-art-of-swedish-death-cleaning/watch-online) about decluttering and clearing out unnecessary items. At the time of writing, the primary resources are the book and via online accounts.


### Hidden Items
There may be important notes, paperwork, stash of cash, information and other items of importance hiding about the property:

-   Go through every page of every book and magazine, all the compartments of every bag, purse and wallet, all pockets in all clothing, look for hidden or secret pockets too.
-   Hidden compartments in the property, furniture, under the floorboards, attic, loft, garden shed, garage.
-   Where else ?

### Important Paperwork
-   Family wills, birth, marriage, death certificates.
	- Make copies and backups !
	- Make good quality scans to digitise and store on computer.
-   Education certificates.
-   Property deeds, you may need to transfer property registration to the inheritors name.
-   Memoirs.
-   Anything else ?

### Digital data, computers, online accounts, etc.
 - Backup (make a copy) their computer data or storage media **before** making any changes to it.

#### Lost passwords, Data recovery
If you are not technically or computer literate you may need help recovering data or account access etc.  
A local [Linux User Group](https://lug.org.uk/lugs/) may have members able to help you.

### Photographs

Whilst nearly all the world has turned to digital photography now, **film and print** photographs remain. These may contain precious memories and be a record of a person's life, family and history. 

Be careful with their handling, preservation and storage, hence... 

#### Protect the source material !

These may be the only photographs in existence with no other copies. 

The source print and film photographic material will degrade over time, to slow that process care should be taken with its preservation and storage, for example, store photographs between acid-free paper as normal paper may be acidic and accelerate degradation.

The [Preservation Equipment Ltd.](https://www.preservationequipment.com/) organisation has materials to help and their website may also inspire some other ideas in you.

#### Some notes, tools and ideas to help:

 - A flat-bed scanner is perhaps the best option for digitising photographic film (slides, transparencies, negatives) and prints, as this will likely produce the best colour reproduction and least distortion.
 - [Hugin](https://hugin.sourceforge.io/) is a versatile tool for combining multiple images to produce panoramas, mosaics or stitch or stack multiple images together to produce a higher resolution image. For example, if a picture is too big to fit on a flat-bed scanner, it may require multiple scans in sections to capture all of it.
 - [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is an excellent free and open source image processing software.
 - Getting more advanced, colourise (colorize) black & white images. GIMP is able to do this but a search of the internet reveals many more [options](https://presearch.com/search?q=colourise+old+photographs%2C+open+source), including [DeOldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify) that uses AI (Artificial Intelligence).
 - [Upscayl](https://upscayl.org/) free and open source software to enhance the resolution of images using AI algorithms.
 - Label photographs, who, what, where, when, why, for your own reference and future generations.


### Preserving their legacy ...how ?
Perhaps the deceased produced some creative work from their hobbies or work that are worth preserving. How will people know about their work and what they did unless it is made visible by some means. What are your options?

Eg. amongst the many practical skills my father had, one of his hobbies was artwork painting, especially portraits and landscapes. How can I make his artwork publicly known, visible, preserved and permanent?:

* Virtual art gallery?
* Exhibition, but may only be temporary.
*  **NFTs :** It is possible to digitise artwork and make it publicly available via [Non-Fungible Token](https://presearch.com/search?q=NFTs+non-fungible+tokens) platforms.
* Consider copyright, attribution and licence issues (eg. [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/)).
* Your suggestions here.

### Cognitive Bias

Be aware of cognitive biases, they can lead to irrational or inaccurate judgements and affect you throughout the processes covered by this guide. 

We have cognitive biases throughout our lives, often not consciously aware of them. They are numerous, take a look at this  [chart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cognitive_Bias_Codex_-_180%2B_biases,_designed_by_John_Manoogian_III_(jm3).jpg#/media/File:Cognitive_Bias_Codex_-_180+_biases,_designed_by_John_Manoogian_III_(jm3).jpg)  on the Wikipedia  [Cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)  page. Everyone's circumstances are different, so in the context of this guide let me give you some examples of my experience from my own circumstances:

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è It was a mighty personal challenge dealing with the contents of my late parents house, about 20% of it was either of sentimental value or useful, so that was okay, but it was the 80% I did not need was where I faced my challenges and cognitive biases. Although I gave a lot to local charity shops I was left with feelings of :
> 
> -   _‚ÄúThis is my parents stuff I‚Äôm giving away!‚Äù_
> -   _‚ÄúWill people respect this the way my parents did‚Äù_
> -   _‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving all this away and getting nothing for it‚Äù_
> -   _‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving away fond memories‚Äù_
> -   etc.
> 
> So I asked one of the large language models available to us now (see [Resources](./#resources) below) to help me identify what cognitive biases I may be facing and experiencing, given my above feelings and circumstances. It suggested quite a few:
> 
> 1.  **Endowment effect:**  You‚Äôre placing a higher value on items simply because they belonged to your parents, even if they‚Äôre not objectively valuable or useful to you.
> 2.  **Loss aversion:**  The fear of losing something valuable by giving away your parents‚Äô possessions is stronger than the potential gain of freeing up space and time.
> 3.  **Sunk cost fallacy:**  You‚Äôre considering the time and effort your parents invested in acquiring and maintaining these items, making it harder to let go.
> 4.  **Emotional attachment bias:**  Your sentimental connection to the items is overriding rational decision-making about their practical value or necessity.
> 5.  **Status quo bias:**  The tendency to prefer things to stay the same is making it difficult for you to make changes to your living situation.
> 6.  **Anchoring bias:**  Your initial perception of the items‚Äô value (based on your parents‚Äô respect for them) is influencing your current assessment of their worth.
> 7.  **Opportunity cost neglect:**  You‚Äôre focusing on the perceived loss of giving items away rather than considering the benefits of freeing up your time and space.
> 8.  **Analysis paralysis:**  The overwhelming nature of the task and the multiple options available (sell, donate, keep) may be causing decision fatigue.

You may face some of these and other cognitive biases yourself, being aware of them can help towards dealing with your own circumstances and matters.

## 3. What do you want to do for the rest of your life ?

Now you have the above sorted, what about you?  
It could be a time of freedom and opportunity to pursue your life!

### Career

- Study ?
- University ?
- Employment ?
- Your intention here ?

Aim at what you want. If you are older, avoid wasting time with 'fill in occupations', use your precious years with ambition.

### Finance, Pension, Income ?

 - State pensions and National Insurance years, see: [https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/)

### Generative AI Tools

May assist you with matters you are dealing with related to this guide. They can be helpful and are easy to use despite their technical-sounding names such as Large Language Models ([LLMs](large%20language%20models)) or Generative Pre-trained Transformer ([GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer)). Simply enter a question, known as a **prompt**, and press `Enter`.

**Generative AI** systems, emerged in 2023, they may be used for interactive 'discussion', however you should independently verify the responses and try asking the same question in a different way and on different platforms or language models. 

Here is an [example](./example-ChatGPT.md) of asking a question to a generative AI system about probate.

These are some LLMs you may like to try:

- [Le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai/chat) Europe based.
- [venice.ai](https://venice.ai/chat) privacy oriented, keeps your discussions on your device.
- [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
- [phind.com](https://www.phind.com/) has a *Think before answering* option in the *Advanced* settings.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)
- [chatbot-arena.web.app](https://chatbot-arena.web.app/) which is the same as [lmarena.ai](https://lmarena.ai/) but with an easier to use interface. This one gives answers from two different LLMs at the same time allowing you to compare various models, form a consensus and optionally vote on your preference.
- [QNA<sup>3</sup>](https://qna3.ai/search) specialised for cryptocurrencies, so perhaps relevant only to those dealing with digital assets.

If you would like to learn more about interacting with language models refer to [promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai/).
