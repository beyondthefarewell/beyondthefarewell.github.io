# Beyond the Farewell
## A Guide

[beyondthefarewell.github.io](https://beyondthefarewell.github.io/)

**Beyond the Farewell** is intended as a guide to the practical matters that need to be dealt with before and beyond an end of life especially in the many months that follow someone's death, beyond the immediate concerns (e.g., death certificate, funeral, pets), the aspects discussed are also applicable to ourselves at any age and any stage of life.

The guide may also be helpful:

- For ourselves at any time from now to our distant future.
- Prior to the decline in mental or physical capacity of the individual,
- in the end of life (EOL) stage of the individual,
- as a resource or of general interest, providing some thoughts and ideas on preparing for eventuality.

It is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both my elderly parents and my interaction with other 'carers'. 

The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work on progress anyway because everyone's circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything❗, but it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere 🌍 🌏 🌎.

I hope it will help.
