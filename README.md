# Beyond the Farewell
## A Guide

[beyondthefarewell.github.io](https://beyondthefarewell.github.io/)

**Beyond the Farewell** is a guide to the matters that need to be dealt with in the months that follow after someones death, beyond the immediate matters (eg. death certificate, funeral).

However I would expect this guide to be especially suitable for carers:


- after the death of the cared for,
- before the loss of mental|physical capacity of the cared for,
- in the end of life stage of the cared for,
- or of general interest providing some thoughts on preparing for eventuality.

It is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both by elderly parents. The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work on progress anyway because everyone's circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything :) but it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere.
