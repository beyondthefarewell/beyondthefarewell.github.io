# Beyond the Farewell
## A Guide

[beyondthefarewell.github.io](https://beyondthefarewell.github.io/)

**Beyond the Farewell** is intended as a guide to the practical matters that need to be dealt with before and beyond an end-of-life, especially in the many months that follow someone's death, beyond the immediate concerns (e.g., death certificate, funeral arrangements, funeral, pets). The aspects discussed are also applicable to ourselves at any age and any stage of life.

The guide may also be helpful:

- For ourselves at any time, from now to our distant future.
- Prior to the decline of an individual’s mental or physical capacity.
- During the end-of-life (EOL) stage of an individual.
- As a resource or of general interest to stimulate thought and spark ideas on preparing for life's eventualities.

The guide is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both my elderly parents and my interaction with other 'carers'. 

The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work in progress anyway, because everyone's circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything 🧠! However it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere in the world 🌍 🌏 🌎.

I hope it will help.
