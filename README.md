# Beyond the Farewell
## A Guide

[beyondthefarewell.github.io](https://beyondthefarewell.github.io/)

**Beyond the Farewell** is a guide to the matters that need to be dealt with in the months that follow after someones death, beyond the immediate matters (eg. death certificate, funeral).

The guide may also be helpful:

- Prior to the decline in mental or physical capacity of the individual,
- in the end of life (EOL) stage of the individual,
- as a resource or of general interest providing some thoughts on preparing for eventuality.

It is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both my elderly parents and my interaction with other 'carers'. 

The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work on progress anyway because everyone's circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything :) but it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere.

I hope it will help.
