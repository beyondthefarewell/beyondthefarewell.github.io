<h1 id="beyond-the-farewell">Beyond the farewell</h1>
<p>A guide to the practical matters that need to be dealt with in the many months that follow after someone’s death, beyond the immediate matters (eg. death certificate, funeral, pets).</p>
<p>The guide may also be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the decline in mental or physical capacity of the individual,</li>
<li>in the end of life (EOL) stage of the individual,</li>
<li>as a resource or of general interest to stimulate some thoughts and spark ideas on preparing for eventuality.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">0. Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> There is plenty of support and information around for people who may be involved in the support or care of an individual who may be infirm, long term sickness, have a disability or be elderly or in the latter time of their life. However beyond the loss of that individual there is little information or support <strong>beyond the farewell</strong> and hence the motivation for producing this guide.</p>
<p>It is based on my own experiences in Britain (United Kingdom) following the eventual and inevitable loss of both my elderly parents and my interaction with other ‘carers’. Consequently this experience also highlights matters for which it would be a great help to deal with before the end of life.</p>
<p>Although U.K. oriented it may be general enough to be a framework guide for most people anywhere.</p>
<p>The guide will be forever incomplete and probably a continuous work on progress anyway because everyone’s circumstances are different and I cannot think of everything!</p>
<p>The guide is not advice, but is intended to offer suggestions and stimulate thoughts and ideas for addressing issues based on your unique circumstances.</p>
<p>I hope it helps.</p>

<h2 id="before-end-of-life">1. Before end of life</h2>
<p>To make future matters easier these are some things to do, consider or arrange for future access well in advance of either the death or loss of mental or physical capacity of someone. To do so after EOL (End Of Life) would be difficult or too late:</p>
<h3 id="financial">Financial</h3>
<ul>
<li>Become a joint account holder on their bank account(s)
<ul>
<li>But <strong>administrate</strong> only !  <br>Else complications arise - you may be viewed as having additional savings and thus be above the threshold for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance">carers allowance</a>, other financial support or be liable for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax">capital gains tax</a>.</li>
<li>A benefit is the account(s) automatically transfer to the surviving holder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney">Power of Attorney</a> is valid only whilst the person is alive.</p>
<h3 id="medical-donation">Medical donation</h3>
<p>Needs to be done weeks or months in advance of the loss of someone and may, or may not, need their permission if they have mental capacity to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Donating organs or body to medical research - find out early, arrange well in advance of death.</li>
<li><a href="https://presearch.com/search?q=brain+bank">Brain bank</a> - search the internet, there may be several to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dna-sample">DNA Sample</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obtain a DNA kit and provide a DNA sample for genealogy purposes – more than one service is better, but may be expensive.</li>
<li>Keep a DNA sample for prosperity or future analysis:
<ul>
<li>Lock of hair?</li>
<li>How to store to preserve and avoid further contamination?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your suggestions ?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="passing-on-the-passwords-passphrases-encryption-keys-usernames-etc">Passing on the passwords, passphrases, encryption keys, usernames etc:</h3>
<p>With the agreement of the account holder consider becoming a joint account holder or administrator on the following, it will make matters easier to deal with beyond EOL.</p>
<ul>
<li>Online banking, Insurance companies</li>
<li>Utilities companies, council</li>
<li>Social media, clubs, societies etc.</li>
<li>Email accounts</li>
<li>Their personal computer login details</li>
<li>Encrypted media</li>
<li>‘Cloud’ data storage</li>
<li>Anything else ?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make backups !</strong></p>
<p>Of course whilst a person is alive, well and able they would likely want to keep<br>
access details a secret, but how could they pass on the details to<br>
executors of a Will, family members or whoever in the event of EOL or loss of<br>
mental capacity or other loss of ability to use a computer?</p>
<p>How you do this will be your joint preference and depend upon your level of technical ability. A couple of thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple option: write down the details and put in a sealed envelope.</li>
<li>The account holder to use a <a href="https://presearch.com/search?q=define%3A%22password+manager%22">password manager</a> (eg. <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>) and pass on, by some agreed means, only the password manager access details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that Wills get published and made public on Grant of Probate, so the above information should not be included in or passed on via a Will.</p>
<h3 id="digital-assets-distributed-ledger-technologies-dlts">Digital Assets, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs)</h3>
<p>Distributed Ledger Technologies are a relatively new technology (2009). It is increasingly possible people may hold these digital assets in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong> eg. Ethereum, Cardano, Monero, Bitcoin and hundreds of others.</li>
<li><strong>NFTs</strong> - Non-fungible tokens</li>
<li><strong>DeFi</strong> - Decentralised finance</li>
</ul>
<p>They may be held in digital wallets (eg. <a href="https://bisq.network/">Bisq</a> or <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus</a>) or on exchanges (eg. <a href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a>). Access to them may require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Public+Private keys.</li>
<li>Wallet password or phrase.</li>
<li>Recovery phrase: a set of words, may be 12 or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>If those are lost the ‘money’ is lost with no means of recovery, so…</p>
<p><strong>Make backups !</strong></p>
<p>Note the digital asset value may or may not be potentially significant:<br>
For example, using the <a href="https://charts.bitbo.io/long-term-power-law/">Bitcoin long term power law</a> as a guide, the approximate minimum price for a whole Bitcoin in Nov. 2022, was US$15,500 (~£14,000). In 2028 that minimum is expected to be US$100,000 and sometime between 2028 and 2037 reach $1,000,000, a significant increase.</p>
<h3 id="family-history">Family History</h3>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>timeline</strong> history of their life.
<ul>
<li>This <a href="https://thetimelineproj.sourceforge.net/">Timeline Project</a> software may help, it’s free and opensource.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Family Tree</strong>, who fits where, who was that relative you met in the past?
<ul>
<li>Of course there are commercial services offering to help with this, but <a href="https://gramps-project.org/">Gramps</a> is free and opensource software you can install on your own computer to assist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pets">Pets</h3>
<p>What should happen to pets after their owner dies ?<br>
What are the owners wishes for them ?<br>
Arrangements need to be made in advance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/">RSPCA</a> offer a <a href="https://homeforlife.org.uk/">Home for Life</a> service to cater for pets after the owner dies.</li>
<li>There is also <a href="https://cinnamon.org.uk/">The Cinnamon Trust</a>, The National Charity for older people, the terminally ill and their pets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="where-is-the-paperwork-">Where is the paperwork ?</h3>
<p>See <a href="./#important-paperwork">Important Paperwork</a> in the next section. Knowing this can ease the process of finding the paperwork later.</p>
<ul>
<li>If any, where and with whom is the Will lodged ?</li>
<li>Have any <strong>wishes</strong> been expressed separate to the Will ? Are these written down somewhere ?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="beyond-end-of-life">2. Beyond end of life</h2>
<p>Matters to attend to beyond the immediate matters following someone’s death.</p>
<p>This may be a challenging time with an overwhelming number of things to deal with and feel surreal in the new reality. It may be filled with mixed emotions and a lifetime of memories as you deal with matters and sorting out.</p>
<h3 id="government--website--tell-us-once">Government  website &amp; Tell Us Once</h3>
<p>Amongst the first things to be done is follow the government website guide <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">What to do when someone dies</a></strong>:<br>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies">https://www.gov.uk/when-someone-dies</a>.</p>
<p>This includes the <strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once">Tell Us Once</a></strong> service to notify multiple government departments and organisations, however consider carefully which to include. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once">https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once</a></p>
<p>It may be wise to notify the <a href="https://dvla.gov.uk">DVLA</a> separately as changing the details in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/driving/number-plate">Log Book</a> will end the current vehicle tax and you would be unable to drive it on public roads. The LOG Book changes may take six weeks to process.</p>
<h4 id="probate-estate-inheritance-tax-and-property-records">Probate, Estate, Inheritance Tax and Property Records</h4>
<p>These are included in the government guide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Probate does not apply to everyone.
<ul>
<li><strong>Grant of probate</strong> gives the executor or administrator the legal authority to manage the deceased person’s assets.</li>
<li>May take up to 16 weeks to process the application.</li>
<li>Apply at your earliest convenience.</li>
<li>Needs to be done within one year of the death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Estimate value of the estate for any Inheritance Tax
<ul>
<li>Inheritance tax is paid on the amount over a threshold. That threshold depends upon individual circumstances.</li>
<li>A property valuation by an estate agent may be required.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update the property records.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="support-ends-suddenly">Support ends suddenly</h3>
<p>Support from care worker visits, health visits, council and government support, telephone support from various charities and agencies all come to an end quite suddenly. You no longer have contact with these support people you have got to know and it may leave you feeling isolated, cut off, alone and forgotten about.</p>
<h4 id="need-someone-to-look-after-you">Need someone to look after YOU</h4>
<p>Depends upon your circumstances, health and age, but if you are the only one left living in the house, who is going to look out for or look after you ?</p>
<h3 id="the-letter-box">The letter box</h3>
<p>Letters arriving in the post can be a help in identifying overlooked matters to deal with or of organisations to notify of the death.</p>
<p>However there may also be unwanted or unneeded promotional advertising mail, a possible way to reduce or stop this was to write <em><strong>Deceased - Return to sender</strong></em> on the envelope and return it in the post box.</p>
<h3 id="return-support-equipment">Return support equipment</h3>
<p>For me this was fairly straight forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact the local council Adult Care Services, arrange for collection of support equipment, mobility aids, wheel chair, safety rails.</li>
<li>Contact fall alarm and other emergency alarm providers.</li>
<li>Institute for Deaf equipment return.</li>
<li>What else ?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physical-personal-items">Physical personal items</h3>
<p>These are part of the Estate.</p>
<p>It is likely thee will be a large number of items to find new home for, eg. clothes, electrical and electronic items, furniture, tools, plant pots, garden equipment, timber, hobby items, vehicles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which to keep for prosperity, sentiment or reuse oneself ?</li>
<li>Sell items (how?):
<ul>
<li>Auctions ?</li>
<li>Internet ?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cashforclothes.org.uk/">Cash for Clothes</a> ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Charity items ?
<ul>
<li>some charities will collect from your location if you cannot take items to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recycle, up-cycle or reuse what’s left ?
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/">Currys</a> will recycle electrical and electronic items : <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/services/delivery-installation/recycling.html">https://www.currys.co.uk/services/delivery-installation/recycling.html</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your suggestions ?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hidden-items">Hidden Items</h3>
<p>There may be important notes, paperwork, stash of cash, information and other items of importance hiding about the property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through every page of every book and magazine, all the compartments of every bag, purse and wallet, all pockets in all clothing, look for hidden or secret pockets too.</li>
<li>Hidden compartments in the property, furniture, under the floorboards, attic, loft, garden shed, garage.</li>
<li>Where else ?</li>

<h3 id="investing-inheritance---financial">Investing inheritance - financial</h3>
<p>If sufficient finance is left over, consider putting the money to use to earn interest, eg.:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.nsandi.com/">National Savings and Investments</a>: Bonds, ISAs etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://presearch.com/search?q=defi+decentralized+finance">DeFi</a>, decentralised finance, a relatively new option, do your own research.</li>
<li>Your suggestions here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preserving-their-legacy-...how-">Preserving their legacy …how ?</h3>
<p>Perhaps the deceased produced some creative work from their hobbies or work that are worth preserving. How will people know about their work and what they did unless it is made visible by some means. What are your options?</p>
<p>Eg. amongst the many practical skills my father had, one of his hobbies was artwork painting, especially portraits and landscapes. How can I make his artwork publicly known, visible, preserved and permanent?:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual art gallery?</li>
<li>Exhibition, but may only be temporary.</li>
<li><strong>NFTs :</strong> It is possible to digitise artwork and make it publicly available via <a href="https://presearch.com/search?q=NFTs+non-fungible+tokens">Non-Fungible Token</a> platforms.</li>
<li>Consider copyright, attribution and licence issues (eg. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>).</li>
